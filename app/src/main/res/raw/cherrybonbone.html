<body><p><br>When I was a kid, I begged my grandma
<br>And she gave me one every once in a while
<br>My heart pounds almost the same way
<br>When I stay up late at night
<br>It’s no illusion
<br>That I’ve grown up, but
<br>I remember it exactly
<br>It tastes the same as it did then 
<br>
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>My cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry bonbon 
<br>
<br>I wonder
<br>If I were to hear
<br>The songs I listened to as a kid
<br>Would they sound different?
<br>My CD player, covered in dust
<br>Becomes a time machine
<br>I get my feelings back
<br>I remember them exactly
<br>They taste the same as they did back then 
<br>
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>My cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>My cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry bonbon 
<br>
<br>I get in my time machine
<br>And remember
<br>How I felt back then
<br>And my dreams from back then
<br>
<br>Cherry bonbon… 
<br>
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>My cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>My cherry cherry cherry bonbon 
<br>Cherry bonbon </p>
