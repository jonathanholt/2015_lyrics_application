<br>Something kind of mysterious
<br>Of course, something ‘secret item’-like
<br>And hard to understand
<br>Like a circle drawn in pen
<br>It’s not perfectly round, but
<br>
<br>It’s just right, a pink one
<br>One that would fit perfectly in the corner of my room
<br>It’s just right, a soft one
<br>I love it, it’s not dangerous
<br>It’s just right, one without any thorns
<br>One with just a tiny bit of sparkle
<br>It’s just right, it’s not you
<br>The way it feels is better than its size
<br>
<br>Hm, what should I go with?
<br>You say it’s your favorite
<br>It’s a little bit different from before
<br>Maybe you haven’t noticed either
<br>Like a line drawn in pen
<br>It’s not perfectly straight, but
<br>
<br>It’s just right, a pink one
<br>One that would fit perfectly in the corner of my room
<br>It’s just right, a soft one
<br>I love it, it’s not dangerous
<br>It’s just right, one without any thorns
<br>One with just a tiny bit of sparkle
<br>It’s just right, it’s not you
<br>The way it feels is better than its size</p>
