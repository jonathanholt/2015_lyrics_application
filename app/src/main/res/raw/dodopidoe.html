<br>“You’d be cute if you lost just a little more weight”
<br>I’m upset because you said something like that to me
<br>Since it is kinda bad when I give my stomach a pinch
<br>I’m gonna work hard to make thin clothes look effortlessly good on me
<br>
<br>I want to be cute and fashionable
<br>But ah, I wanna eat chocolate and stuff
<br>I wanna eat, I wanna eat something sweet
<br>

<br>do do pi do do pi do do pi do oh yeh
<br>I’m gonna be a sexy cutie
<br>do do pi do do pi do do pi do oh yeh
<br>Pumpkin pie, ice cream on pancakes, soda
<br>I wanna eat pumpkin pie, popsicles, french toast
<br>A sexy silly cutie
<br>do do pi do do pi do do pi do oh yeh
<br>
<br>I once tried to work out every day
<br>3 2 1… but I end up eating afterwards without even realizing it
<br>There’s something magical about yummy things
<br>So I end up wanting to eat more and more, but I’ve gotta show some self-control
<br>
<br>I want to be cute and fashionable
<br>But ah, I wanna eat chocolate and stuff
<br>I wanna eat, I wanna eat something sweet
<br>I wanna eat, I wanna eat, I wanna eat something sweet
<br>
