<br>I know our big dreams, they’re glimmering
<br>Over the waves, to the land in the distance
<br>Because we want to know lots and lots of thrills
<br>
<br>I’ll be going, going with you
<br>When you open the rainbow-colored window

<br>Today I’ll be going again, with the best companions I could ever ask for

<br>I know our big hopes, they’re glimmering
<br>Over the hills to the city in the distance
<br>Because we want to make your hearts pound lots and lots
