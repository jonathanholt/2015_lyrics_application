<body><p><br>Fashion Monster x4
<br>
<br>Don’t you think it’s boring when you wanna say it’s interesting, but you can’t?
<br>I don’t wanna be the same and be a good girl, I’m sure you don’t either
<br>
<br>I don’t want to be bound by someone else’s rules
<br>I’m so selfish, my heart is pounding, I want to stay the way I am
<br>
<br>Fashion Monster x2
<br>I want to break the narrow cage of my heart and be free
<br>Fashion Monster x4
<br>
<br>I can sharpen up my senses, like you
<br>Sucking it all in so it looks like a spiral　I wanna be free
<br>Fashion Monster
<br>
<br>I just want to live my life normally: isn’t it boring to say that I’m weird?
<br>Don’t judge me, I don’t wanna be a good girl, I’m sure you don’t either
<br>
<br>I don’t want to be bound by someone else’s rules
<br>I’m so selfish, my heart is pounding, I want to stay the way I am
<br>
<br>Fashion Monster x2
<br>I just want to take off my iron necklace and live freely
<br>Fashion Monster x4
<br>
<br>Fashion Monster x2
<br>I want to break the narrow cage of my heart and be free
