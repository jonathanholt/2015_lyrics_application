<body><p><br>Let’s get on the 10 AM train
<br>And go, go to the town we always go to
<br>Swayed by the sound from my headphones
<br>As I stare at today’s landscape
<br>When I run, run, run through
<br>Takeshita Street*, which is getting crowded 
<br>I [run into] another traffic light and then cross
<br>Because that’s where everyone is
<br>
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it? Or am I just barely “out”?
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it?
<br>
<br>Let’s get on the 1 PM train
<br>And go, go to the town we always go to
<br>On my days off, I can see you 
<br>Do I look different from usual? It’s so me
<br>The shop I’ve stopped in is so wonderful
<br>That I’m in a trance, trance, trance
<br>I’ve got a date, I check my watch
<br>Been waiting so long for you I’m getting impatient
<br>
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it? Or am I just barely “out”?
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it?
<br>
<br>It’s just like a crepe
<br>That’s been filled to bursting, isn’t it?
<br>The energy of this town,
<br>Which is like a treasure chest
<br>
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it? Or am I just barely “out”?
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it?
<br>
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it? Or am I just barely “out”?
<br>Am I just in time? Am I just in time?
<br>Did I just barely make it?
<br>
<br>Let’s go, go to the town we always go to
<br>This town’s… because everyone’s there…
