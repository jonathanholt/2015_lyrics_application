<body><p><br>Perfect form
<br>I want you see it in my expression, in how moved I am
<br>Perfect form
<br>I wanna break through my limits and go
    <br>
    <br>I’ve been expanding, bit by bit
    <br>From the little idea I had that day
    <br>The amazing thought I had
    <br>It travels like a water drop
    <br>Footsteps of mine, bridge the distance
    <br>
    <br>I don’t want to regret anything
    <br>Because you can’t save in life
    <br>There are things I’d like to try
    <br>There’s so many things I want to see
    <br>Listen in, into the light
