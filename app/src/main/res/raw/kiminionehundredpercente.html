<body><p><br>The power you’re putting out is real
<br>How serious are you, by what percent?
<br>Someday I’ll go all out - 100 percent
<br>It’ll be tiring, but
<br>
<br>It’s best to properly let people know
<br>When you feel like saying “thank you”
<br>Or feel like saying “I’m sorry”, right?
<br>I wonder if I can be honest with you
<br>
<br>Starting tomorrow I’m going to buckle down and get serious so
<br>Hey heey, I’m sleepy sleepy
<br>It’d be better for me to try after I get a good night’s rest
<br>
<br>I’ll tell you, tell you
<br>100 percent of my feelings for you
<br>I haven’t had enough practice
<br>With some percent of those feelings either, but
<br>
<br>I’ll tell you, tell you
<br>100 percent of my feelings for you
<br>And we’ll all be able to smile
<br>Energetic as always
