<br>Romantic, dramatic, not just cute
<br>Gonna be someone different, let’s go to a whole new world
<br>Plastic, fantastic, where I can be free

<br>Look, let’s change your clothes in the wink of an eye
<br>Transformations are fun, c’mon, let’s keep going
<br>
<br>I’ll be a new person, with brand new feelings
<br>Romantic, dramatic mysteries, not dreams
<br>Gonna be someone different, let’s go to a whole new world
<br>Plastic, fantastic, where I can be free

<br>She flips through the pages and worries about every little thing
<br>A little witch girl who wants to master her imagination, her magic
<br>But Mommy knocks on the door and scolds her to go to bed
<br>Let’s watch the rest of it in dream land, in dream land
<br>
<br>I’m gonna be a whole new me
<br>Romantic, dramatic, not just cute
<br>Gonna be someone different, let’s go to a whole new world
<br>Plastic, fantastic, where I can be free </p>
