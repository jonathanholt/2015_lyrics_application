<br>
<br>Next Sunday is the BBQ I’ve been waiting and waiting for
<br>The sun in the clear sunny sky, yes, everything is on my side
<br>
<br>Now’s my chance! You waved at me, my heart’s pounding
<br>A prince riding on a white horse is bound to come for me
<br>
<br>I want you… I want you darling
<br>You’re mine and mine alone, darling!
<br>Maybe we’ll smooch… I’m sure we will, darling
<br>I, I crazy for you
<br>Every night, I cry for your love yeah!
<br>
<br>I lick a piece of candy and roll it around in my mouth
<br>Why can’t I get you, ah, off my mind… ?
<br>
<br>Remembering back then, it feels like some kind of dream now
<br>Every time our eyes meet, our hearts pound and we kiss
<br>Right now is bound to be fun too, right!?
<br>
<br>I want you… I want you darling
<br>You’re mine and mine alone, darling!
<br>Maybe we’ll smooch… I’m sure we will, darling
<br>I, I crazy for you
<br>Every night, I cry for your love yeah!
<br>
<br>Loving with you tonight…
<br>My feelings for you won’t change, but
<br>Be more, more honest with me
<br>And we’ll be best friends forever!
<br>
<br>I want you… I want you darling
<br>You’re mine and mine alone, darling!
<br>Maybe we’ll smooch… I’m sure we will, darling
<br>I, I crazy for you
<br>Every night, I cry for your love yeah!</p>
