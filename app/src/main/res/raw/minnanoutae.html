<br>Spread your arms, spread your arms
<br>Clap clap…
<br>
<br>Just by clapping with both hands
<br>You’ll feel more cheerful
<br>Let’s match the rhythm
<br>Let’s all get in a circle and clap
<br>
<br>Put your hands up, put your hands up
<br>Spread your arms, spread your arms
<br>Clap clap…
<br>
<br>See, isn’t it easy?
<br>You don’t have to think about anything
<br>Isn’t it nice how you can make everyone smile
<br>With the power of music?
<br>Just by clapping with both hands
<br>You’ll feel more cheerful
<br>Let’s match the rhythm
<br>Let’s all get in a circle and clap
<br>
<br>Finally, finally, I get it
<br>I’d love to forget the things I hate
<br>I’m sure, I’m sure I’d smile about it
<br>I’d love to be selfish forever, forever
<br>
<br>Put your hands up, put your hands up
<br>Spread your arms, spread your arms
