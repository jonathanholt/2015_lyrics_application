<body><p><br>The moonlight late on a cold, windy night
<br>Shines and lights up my tomorrow
<br>It looks more difficult than I thought 
<br>I try to reach out to the black sky where the stars are shining 
<br>I’m about to be sucked
<br>Into its deep darkness 
<br>
<br>When I close my eyes, the miracle orange is there
<br>I’m about to reach it, just a little more
<br>
<br>In my dreams, the distance between you and me
<br>As we dance back and forth from each other is 100 centimeters more
<br>I take a huge step forward 
<br>Cast a spell, and run barefoot
<br>I’d go anywhere to see you
<br>I’m not scared, this power
<br>Is a miracle power
<br>
<br>Back then was so nice, my first ever midnight
<br>It shakes up my tomorrow 
<br>My feelings toward you are just getting stronger
<br>
<br>When I close my eyes, the miracle orange is there
<br>I’m just about to grab it, just a little more 
<br>
<br>In my dreams, the distance between you and me
<br>As we go around and around is seven centimeters more
<br>I take a little step forward
<br>Cast a spell, and we hold hands
<br>Walking next to you, I couldn’t be better
<br>The orange color is infinite
<br>A miracle power </p>
