<body><p><br>“You’re different from the rest of us” we say when we criticize someone
<br>But do people who’re like everyone else all the time even exist?!
<br>
<br>It’s such a wa-a-aste that you’re bent on holding others back,
<br>Not having the courage to transform the longing you’ve got for the things you can’t do into anything
<br>
<br>I’m just in love
<br>I’m not living my life like some robot
<br>
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>I don’t wanna be bored
<br>You’ve gotta problem too
<br>You can’t get used to what’s normal either, can you?
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl?
<br>Do the decent seek the decent?
<br>I am a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>Gotta Problem Girl, Gotta Problem Girl
<br>
<br>I wanna cry because of wonderful things
<br>instead of smiling because of things I hate
<br>I’ve got someone I can be with when the world collapses
<br>
<br>There’s no way I could be a goody-goody who just responds to requests
<br>I wanna put sparkly make-up on anybody who gets in my wa-a-ay
<br>
<br>I’m just in love
<br>Not meeting your expectations isn’t selfish of me
<br>
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>I don’t wanna be bored
<br>You’ve gotta problem too
<br>You can’t get used to what’s normal either, can you?
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl?
<br>Do the decent seek the decent?
<br>I am a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>Gotta Problem Girl, Gotta Problem Girl 
<br>
<br>I’m just in love
<br>I’m not living my life like some robot
<br>
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>I don’t wanna be bored
<br>You’ve gotta problem too
<br>You can’t get used to what’s normal either, can you?
<br>I’m a Gotta Problem Girl?
<br>Do the decent seek the decent?
<br>I am a Gotta Problem Girl
<br>Gotta Problem Girl, Gotta Problem Girl
