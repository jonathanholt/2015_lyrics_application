<body><p><br>Since it’s too lovely to waste, since it’s too lovely to waste
<br>I dream of it and cry, ah
<br>Since I wanna stay longer, since it’s not enough for me
<br>I end up doing mean things to you
<br>Walking through the brilliant city
<br>These sparkling lights that will disappear tomorrow
<br>Are too lovely to waste, too lovely to waste
<br>Hey, let’s go together to the Mottai Night Land
<br>
<br>An amazing, perfectly round moon is out on the weekend we’ve been waiting and waiting for 
<br>Great job you’ve done there, Mr. Moon! Bedtime’s sure to come
<br>Tonight even all of the scary ghosts will want to smile at you
<br>I know they’ll appear, brought along by all the sweet smells
<br>
<br>A night lit up by the candles glittering throughout the city
<br>I stare at it from atop a paved hill
<br>I wish this scenery would last forever
<br>C'mon, let’s go
<br>
<br>Since it’s too lovely to waste, since it’s too lovely to waste
<br>I dream of it and cry, ah
<br>Since I wanna stay longer, since it’s not enough for me
<br>I end up doing mean things to you
<br>Walking through the brilliant city
<br>These sparkling lights that will disappear tomorrow
<br>Are too lovely to waste, too lovely to waste
<br>Hey, let’s go together to the Mottai Night Land
<br>
<br>The charm I bought that day, a necklace made of mysteries
<br>A complete account of our struggles fighting bad guys
<br>Tonight I know we’ll be saying hello to all sorts of magical worlds
<br>I know they’ll appear, lured in by all the sweet smells
<br>
<br>A night lit up by the candles glittering throughout the city
<br>I stare at it from atop a paved hill
<br>I wish this scenery would last forever
<br>C'mon, it’s still far from over
<br>
<br>Since it’s too lovely to waste, since it’s too lovely to waste
<br>I dream of it and cry, ah
<br>Since I wanna stay longer, since it’s not enough for me
<br>I end up doing mean things to you
<br>Walking through the brilliant city
<br>These sparkling lights that will disappear tomorrow
<br>Are too lovely to waste, too lovely to waste
<br>Hey, let’s go together to the Mottai Night Land
<br>
<br>When my slight expectations
<br>Light up like a parade
<br>I’ll stay behind with my memories together with you
<br>We’ll go to sleep among the stars in the sky
<br>But it’s still far from over
<br>
<br>Since it’s too lovely to waste, since it’s too lovely to waste
<br>I dream of it and cry, ah
<br>Since I wanna stay longer, since it’s not enough for me
<br>I end up doing mean things to you
<br>Walking through the brilliant city
<br>These sparkling lights that will disappear tomorrow
<br>Are too lovely to waste, too lovely to waste
<br>Hey, let’s go together to the Mottai Night Land</p>
