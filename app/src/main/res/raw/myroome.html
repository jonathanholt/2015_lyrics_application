<body><p><br>House facing the sea
<br>I’m looking for my own
<br>A town to make my future in, glittering, shimmering
<br>My room facing the sea
<br>
<br>A little “Hm?”
<br>Now I’d love to, yeah, notice things
<br>That I would’ve thought about when I was little
<br>
<br>I wanna be surrounded by things I love
<br>Jump out of tight spaces and get them
<br>
<br>House facing the sea
<br>I’m looking for my own
<br>A town to make my future in, glittering, shimmering
<br>My room facing the sea 
<br>
<br>Hey, how’re you feeling?
<br>Laughing when you remember what you were so worried about back then
<br>I wanna give it a try
<br>
<br>Excited in my new room
<br>Humming a song of beginnings
<br>
<br>House facing the sea
<br>I’m looking for my own
<br>A town to make my future in, glittering, shimmering
<br>My room facing the sea 
<br>
<br>House facing the sea
<br>I’m looking for my own
<br>A town to make my future in, glittering, shimmering
<br>My room facing the sea </p>
