<body><p><br>Just being cute is so boring
<br>It’s not enough to just be new either
<br>
<br>It’s totally different, like when you hear
<br>Half a joke - a serious story
<br>
<br>100% me, 100% one O O
<br>I’ll be able to say that I’m 100% me
<br>
<br>I pretend that I’m trying the absolute best I can
<br>Even though I’m keeping my me-ness a secret
<br>
<br>I get excited, thinking how to time it someday
<br>How rude of you to say, “It’s not very like…”
<br>
<br>100% me, 100% one O O
<br>I’ll be able to say that I’m 100% me
<br>100% me, 100% one O O
<br>Because I’ll be able to say that I’m 100% me
<br>100% me<br><br>
