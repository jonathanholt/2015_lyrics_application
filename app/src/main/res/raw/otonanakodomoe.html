<body><p><br>I feel like I understood
<br>More about adults than I usually do
<br>Pushing myself so that I’m hovering between finally
<br>being one and not being one is just right for me
<br>
<br>I feel like I even understood
<br>More about adults than I usually do
<br>Being kind and gentle, but innocent…is a good adult
<br>someone who has that kind of sparkle to them?
<br>
<br>You’re always so kind
<br>You teach me all kinds of things
<br>And when it’s really important
<br>You put on a serious face
<br>
<br>I want only what I want, so I’m in the way
<br>When I’m tugging on the hems of your clothes
<br>
<br>I feel like I understood
<br>More about adults than I usually do
<br>Pushing myself so that I’m hovering between finally
<br>being one and not being one is just right for me
<br>
<br>I’m sure you felt like you understood
<br>More about adults too
<br>It’s okay to stay the way you are: mischievous,
<br>kinda intellectual, with that sort of sparkle in you 
<br>
<br>You smile so softly
<br>You surprise me
<br>And even when you make a face like I’m bothering you
<br>At crucial moments, you protect me
<br>
<br>I can’t be quiet and obedient
<br>Sorry that I can’t meet your expectations
<br>

<br>It’s okay to stay that way
<br>Go ahead and keep on sparkling
