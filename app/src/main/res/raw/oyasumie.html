<body><p><br>We had a good time, didn’t we?
<br>It’ll be ending soon, but
<br>I’m sure all of us
<br>Will get together again
<br>Thank you
<br>Today I’ll go to bed
<br>Holding a bunch of memories to my chest
<br>
<br>This story is already
<br>Coming to an end, so let’s close the book,
<br>Close our eyes, and float up into the night sky
<br>When you’re awoken by the alarm clock of the sun,
<br>Remember today and see? You’ll smile
<br>
<br>When you open your present, a pretty box
<br>And are covered in sparkles,
<br>You’ll sleep soundly
<br>
<br>It’s sad when the closing chime
<br>Echoes with a “ring ring”, but
<br>I’m sure we’ll be together again in our dreams
<br>Thank you
<br>Today I’ll go to bed
<br>Holding a bunch of memories to my chest
<br>
<br>When you open your present, a pretty box
<br>And are covered in sparkles,
<br>You’ll sleep soundly
<br>
<br>You’ll sleep soundly
<br>You’ll go to sleep
