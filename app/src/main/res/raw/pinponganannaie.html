I’m not always like this, but
<br>Every now and then I feel this way
<br>I take my heavy bag in hand
<br>And pedal my bicycle down the hilly road
<br>I get out my gigantic ladle
<br>Go ahead and get all my different things ready
<br>Then I wait for you to come back home, but
<br>The doorbell just doesn’t ring
<br><br>
<br>It’s like how fatty
<br>A bubbling stew is
<br>You wouldn’t be able to tell in one look, but
<br>It gets really tasty when you put your heart into it
<br>I type out a text to you, but
<br>There’s no reply from you at all
<br>Before my fickle feelings cool down
<br>Come home to me (the doorbell doesn’t ring)
<br>Come home to me (the doorbell doesn’t ring)
    <br><br>
<br>What do you want me to put in it after I’ve added
<br>The cabbage, carrots, wheat flour
<br>Potatoes, onion, parsley
<br>Butter, and cream of mushroom?
<br>Salt and pepper in the soup wine
<br>And don’t forget the bacon
<br>I wait for you to come back home, but
<br>The doorbell just doesn’t ring
    <br><br>
