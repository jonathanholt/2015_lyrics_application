<body><p><br>Working all day   “You worked hard today”
<br>“Home sweet home”   I wanna sleep in my bed, but I persevere
<br>For now I sink myself deep into my bathtub
<br>I can’t wait for “it”…  I’m gonna hurry up and go get some
<br>
<br>Flavor’s great, shape’s great, color’s great, smell’s great
<br>Even though I was looking forward to it so so so much…
<br>
<br>The last ice cream
<br>Ice cream, the strawberry-flavored kind
<br>They’re out of ice cream ice cream
<br>I won’t forgive the one who ate it, the spoon in my right hand’s a lethal weapon
<br>Ice cream ice cream, the strawberry-flavored kind
<br>They’ve run out of ice cream ice cream
<br>It’s always so hard to find
<br>Even though they put out that ice cream…
<br>
<br>Everything about it’s so exquisitely balanced
<br>When you eat it, it brings you to a world of happiness
<br>
<br>Flavor’s great, shape’s great, color’s great, smell’s great
<br>Even though I was looking forward to it so so so much…
<br>
<br>The last ice cream
<br>Ice cream, the strawberry-flavored kind
<br>They’re out of ice cream ice cream
<br>I won’t forgive the one who ate it, the spoon in my right hand’s a lethal weapon
<br>Ice cream ice cream, the strawberry-flavored kind
<br>They’ve run out of ice cream ice cream
<br>It’s always so hard to find
<br>Even though they put out that ice cream…
<br>
<br>Talking about how delicious it is
<br>Talking about how it’s SOOO delicious
<br>
<br>The last ice cream
<br>Ice cream, the strawberry-flavored kind
<br>They’re out of ice cream ice cream
<br>I won’t forgive the one who ate it, the spoon in my right hand’s a lethal weapon
