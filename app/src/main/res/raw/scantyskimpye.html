<br>I hate when things fit too tight
<br>charming charming
<br>I just want to be cute
<br>Scanty Skimpy
<br>What do I do, the sweets are so tempting
<br>But the calories…
<br>My stomach’s all huffy with me
<br>
<br>That’s kinda sorta weird
<br>I put it on gingerly and
<br>Whoa, what the heck!?
<br>The buttons are just barely hanging in there
<br>Heart racing from the inside of my closet
<br>Even though I was thinking of wearing it for the first time in a long time

<br>But the calories…
<br>My stomach’s all huffy with me
<br>
<br>I wake up hungry
<br>And nibble on some crackers
<br>Whoa, what the heck!?
<br>I’ve gobbled up the whole box
<br>I’m already late, OMG
<br>No problem, nope, not at all
<br>Excuses, excuses
