<body><p><br>I’m used to texting you ahead of time,
<br>Thinking you’ve forgotten our plans
<br>Do you really not think of me seriously?
<br>I don’t know, I even pretend to be mad and you don’t get it
<br>
<br>The beginning was a rainy day like this one
<br>Just when I really need you to be, you’re so kind to me 
<br>
<br>It’s so unfair, I love you so much I’m gonna flip out
<br>I have to sparkle or it’ll be no use
<br>I want you to decide not to leave me
<br>So I’m gonna make your heart pound
<br>I want you to kiss me, except for “I’m sorry” kisses
<br>But you’re so cold and short with me
<br>You’re so strange
<br>I l-love you so much I’m gonna flip out
<br>I Love You
<br>
<br>My favorite you is when you make me look surprised
<br>With your forte, pretending like you’re not thinking about anything  
<br>Like the present you gave me after acting like you’d forgotten
<br>On the anniversary I thought you didn’t do anything for me
<br>
<br>The beginning was a hot day like this one 
<br>Just when I really need you to be, you’re so kind to me  
<br>
<br>It’s so unfair, I love you so much I’m gonna flip out 
<br>I have to sparkle or it won’t be any good, will it?
<br>Seeing you surrounded with cute girls
<br>Is making my heart pound, so
<br>I want you to kiss me, except for “I’m sorry” kisses
<br>I don’t want to hear about what you like
<br>Just look at me
<br>I Love You 
<br>
