<body><p><br>It’s Sunday and the temperature’s just right
<br>I take a refreshingly lukewarm shower
<br>And choose my clothes slowly, but
<br>What I what, what I want, is something new
<br>I wish I could go beyond this “just right” feeling
<br>Try out some different things
<br>And be cuter
<br>Cute enough to make you say, “Amazing, amazing”
<br>
<br>What should I do? I wonder
<br>If I could polish up these positive feelings
<br>I’ll think it out, I’ll put all my imagination into it
<br>And be surrounded by wonderful
<br>
<br>On the path I’m taking a stroll on, there’s a cat
<br>Walking a slight distance away from me
<br>But when I call for it to come to me
<br>Saying “Here kitty kitty!”, it runs away
<br>I’m at the age where challenging yourself is more important
<br>Than doing things the same as always
<br>I wish I could be cute
<br>Cute enough to make you say, “Amazing, amazing”
<br>
<br>What should I do? I wonder
<br>If I could polish up these positive feelings
<br>I’ll think it out, I’ll put all my imagination into it
<br>And be surrounded by wonderful
<br>
<br>A girl enveloped in such an amazin’ aura
<br>That she’s blindingly bright
<br>
<br>What should I do? I wonder
<br>If I could polish up these positive feelings
<br>I’ll think it out, I’ll put all my imagination into it
<br>And be surrounded by wonderful
