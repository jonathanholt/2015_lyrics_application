<body><p><br>Little things moving about
<br>Like they’re under a microscope
<br>I bet if you looked at it from the sky
<br>Our speed would look miniature too
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>The whole town’s in a hurry
<br>We won’t be the only ones to stop
<br>I guess we got closer
<br>Going beyond dizzying speeds
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>Bass bumpin’ along
<br>Feeling the wind whizzing by
<br>Past the ocean tunnel
<br>I can see our town
<br>
<br>La la la…
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway, a shimmering town
<br>Make our way to the stars, this shiny color
<br>Tokyo Highway, zooming on through
<br>Until we’re going the same speed as light
<br>
<br>Tokyo Highway…</p>
