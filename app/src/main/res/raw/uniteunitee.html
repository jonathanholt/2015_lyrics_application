<body><p><br>I actually don’t have any self confidence
<br>And I’m also terrible at talking with people
<br>Behind my perfect smile
<br>See? I’m hiding my complexes
<br>It’s not enough, it’s still not enough
<br>I can’t catch up with everyone
<br>Since I can’t help it
<br>I’ve gotta find my own unique weapon
<br>
<br>unite unite all original
<br>When we all unite, we can be
<br>unite unite all original
<br>Something that won’t be beat by anyone
<br>
<br>I wish I could be
<br>Like a superstar or something
<br>A super stylish superstar
<br>Who on an amazing start
<br>Like a superstar
<br>Has an amazing spurt
<br>Several times faster than the others, but…
<br>
<br>I wanted to reasonably enjoy
<br>The same things as everyone else
<br>So, determined, I devoted myself to it
<br>By doing the best I could on my own
<br>I’ll catch up to them, no, win it back
<br>I want to fill that something
<br>That was missing in me back then
<br>Even now I still struggle with it
<br>
