<body><p>>All the truly great memories of everything that’s happened so far
<br>I cram them into my suitcase, I won’t forget them
<br>I guess the future, from now on, is all up to me
<br>I’m off to buy a thrilling ticket to it
<br>
<br>Goodbye teacher, my friends
<br>The butterflies in my stomach from starting off on my journey
<br>Sour candy lips
<br>Big hopes for the big city I know nothing of
<br>Goodbye teacher, my friends
<br>Thank you, please give me some courage
<br>From the room that’s mine and mine alone is the beginning-ring of a dream
<br>
<br>This road I’ve walked every day until now
<br>I won’t be able to see it for a while, which makes me feel lonely
<br>Feeling the hopes and anxieties I have for tomorrow
<br>“Farewell”    I want to make it come true no matter what, so
<br>
<br>Goodbye teacher, my friends
<br>The butterflies in my stomach from starting off on my journey
<br>And the tears I’m biting down
<br>On my sour candy lips to hold back
<br>Goodbye teacher, my friends
<br>Thank you, please give me some courage
<br>From the room that’s mine and mine alone is the beginning-ring of a dream
<br>
<br>Goodbye teacher, my friends
